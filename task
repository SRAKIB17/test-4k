1) i need to change the paypal method payment to be paypal sandbox (i heard its a free thing to do )
2) you know in admin dashboard u have the close order for cash orders
so you can as well cancel the order instead of closing it and by that u update the quantity of that particular item +1
3) we need to make some page in the admin dashboard where u can update day by day stock/quantity of items
